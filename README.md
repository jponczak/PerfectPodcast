## Podcast Summary
The Perfect Podcast solves a number of annoyances for those who commute every day and are tired of getting to work in the middle of a story.

This app simply calculates the distance and time between two addresses, captures your interests (like politics, soccer, ...), and returns a number of podcasts. These podcasts are tailored to your interests ***and*** you can hear the entire eposide during your commute.

Developed in Semantic HTML, Responsive CSS, and JQuery, the app fully supports a wide variety of platforms, operating systems, and browsers.
