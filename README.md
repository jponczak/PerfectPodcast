## Podcast Summary
The Perfect Podcast solves a number of annoyances for those who commute every day and are tired of getting to work in the middle of a story.

This app  calculates the distance and time between two addresses, captures your interests (like politics, soccer, ...), and returns a number of podcasts. These podcasts are tailored to your interests ***and*** you can hear the entire eposide during your commute. You can also get step by step directions between your To and From addresses if you want to.

Developed in Semantic HTML, Responsive CSS, and JQuery, the app fully supports a wide variety of platforms, operating systems, and browsers.
